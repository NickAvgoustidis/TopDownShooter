# TopDownShooter

This is a top down shooter game in progress. 
The purpose of this project, is to give free access to anyone want to check it out, mess around or contribute to it. 

It started as a side project to take my mind of some personal problems, but it is shaping nicely, so why not?

The general goal is to make a simple cool game, and then release it. 

I will add a Design Document, and my moodboard / collage of concept art(s) to showcase the idea of the feel / aisthetics and graphics, that I want to go for
at the polished product. 

Cheers!
